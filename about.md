I am Data Engineer by profession, working for a transportation & logistics
startup called Shuttl. We are trying to enable stress-free commute for the
working class.

I do have experience working for a variety of businesses. Prior to this I have
worked with a Customer Experience Management platform, an all-in-one app,
a consumer micro-finance company, a software services company and an engineering college.
